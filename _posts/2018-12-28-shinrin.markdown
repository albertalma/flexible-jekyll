*Join Shinrin in her adventure to save the forest*
---------------------

## About

Shinrin (prototype name) is a 2d arcade game where you will a join a young girl through a magic forest where something is happening and seems that their habitants need your help.

The current game is thought to be played on mobile devices and its core mechanics are based on the classic "Pang" where you have things bouncing around the screen and you should shoot them vertically.

Current game is in a really early stage and everything shown here can be really different in the final stage.

## Our main Character
"Shinrin" is a young girl that don't know how, but has woken up on a strange forest. Where a magical friend has give her a water gun to defend herself and protect the forest.

## The Game

## Levels

Shinrin progression is going to be through levels where the players need to kill all the enemies in order to pass to the next one.

In each level the enemies are going to be appearing through waves and through different locations of the scene.

### Mechanics

The game mechanics are supposed to be very simple, in the end the player is going to be able to move from right to left across the screen and shoot vertically to kill the enemies.

Since the game is being thought for mobile devices we are thinking on different types of controls in order to find the better way to enjoy the game. Right now we have this three type of controls:
* Arrows: On the game screen there will be two buttons like a pad for going right and left.
* Joystick: Use a joystick on the game screen in order to go right or left.
* Automatic: The character moves right or left depending which side of the screen you press (shots automatically).

## Extras

Among the core mechanics the game is going to include different extras like:
* Boss Levels
* In-game boosters and helpers
* Leaderboards
* ...
