Bus Time BCN was an Android application that I developed during my senior year in college.

## How it started?
The idea started because at that moment the official application that was on the market was only an app where you put a code and it retrieved you the arrival time for the buses, but in my case I was used to use different bus stops so that mean different codes and no way to save them on the application.

This is when I started looking for open data services or something in order to make an application that was simple but still a bit more useeful than the current one.

## The final application
The first version of the application was released at beginning of October 2013. It was an application that fulfill its purpose, with it the users where able to check the arrival time of the buses and also save the stops that they want with a name.

After a couple of months I started to notice that the number of users where starting to grow more and more and at that moment I decided to ask for a proper design for it.

# Conclusion
This was the first project that I embrace by my own and was really fun and interesting. 
It was working for almost `5 years` and it was used for more than `3000 users` but at June 2018 I was focusing myself on other projects so I decided to close the application.
