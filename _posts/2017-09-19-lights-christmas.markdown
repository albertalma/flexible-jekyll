Lights Christmas was going to be a mobile game based on the concept of the Lights Out game.

> Lights Out is an electronic game released by Tiger Electronics in 1995. The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off, preferably in as few button presses as possible.


## The idea
The idea was to make a mobile game using the Lights Out mechanics adding some extras such as a saga map, lifes for playing, ads... And over this add a christmas layer to use as story.

## The story & mechanics
The main plot of the game was that Santa needed help because the Grinch was causing trouble (again) and in each level the user was going to have different challenges in order to help him.

For example the first level (tutorial) was supposed to be that Santa had lost the tree balls and the user must help him "founding" them. So in order to "find it", the user must solve a Lights Out challenge and so on on the differents levels, where the user was supposed to help with christmas candies, candles, ice, among other christmas typical objects.

# Conclusion
Lights Christmas was a big project that involved a team of 4 people: 2 developers, a game designer and an artist. The game was done using Cocos2D and was supposed to be released during Christmas 2017-2018.

Unafortunately even that the main mechanics (Lights out mechanics, life system, ads, level definition with JSON...) were finished there was no enough time to add a proper christmas layer or a proper design for the game in order to be released that christmas. After that all the team decided to postpone the release of it.

The current status of the game is canceled.
